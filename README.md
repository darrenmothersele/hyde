Hyde Theme Generator
--------------------

##What is Hyde?

This started out as a Drupal theme generator packaged along side a prototyping
tool built using Jekyll, hence the name Hyde.

    Edward Hyde is not a separate personality living in the same body as
    Henry Jekyll. "Hyde" is just Jekyll, having transformed his body into
    something unrecognizable
    -- Steven Padnick, in
    [What Everybody Gets Wrong About Jekyll and Hyde](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/what-everybody-gets-wrong-about-jekyll-and-hyde)

This actually works with any static HTML/CSS/JS.

The end result is a Drupal theme made up of various plugins for
Display Suite, Panels, and Views.

##Status

VERY rushed proof-of-concept code.

This code has been quickly hacked together to prove a point. It is to be
totally re-written as the ideas of how this system will work become more real.

Definitely don't use this in production.

In fact, you probably shouldn't use this at all.  It needs a lot of work.
